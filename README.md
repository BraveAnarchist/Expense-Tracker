- Tailwind CSS: For responsive design.
## Challenges

1. Responsive Design:
Implementing a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing experiences across a wide range of devices and screen sizes presented a significant challenge. Expecially since Tailwind is a mobile first approach and here I had designed the website from a laptop's view. 

2. Implementing Gemini Ai's multi-turn conversations version proved to be a challenge. Especially since I'm on the free tier. So finding the sweet spot of max-token allowed was time consuming. Documentation was also a little hard to digest.
